# ChunkwiseSearch
With this, I can find an Item without search through head to toe of array.


# Whats it for?
Let an array $entry = [a, b, c, d, e, ..., ax, ay, az, ba, ..., ts, tt, 1, 2, 3, ...];
What if I want to find a first integer value of this array?
Your machine probably fast enough to through all items but.. what if the array has 150k items or even more?
